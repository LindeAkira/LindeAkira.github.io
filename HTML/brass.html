  <h2>Best Brass Instruments</h2>
        <p>
          Brass instruments are made of brass (of course) and is played by buzzing your lips into a mouthpiece attached to one end of the instrument. By changing the shape of your lips and using different valves or a slide, you can control the pitch and produce different notes.
